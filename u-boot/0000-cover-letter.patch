Subject: [PATCH 0/2] efi_loader: implement EFI_DT_FIXUP_PROTOCOL

Device-trees are often Linux version specific. So it seems reasonable to
let GRUB load device-trees according to the selected kernel version.
What currently is missing is a means to let the firmware apply necessary
fix-ups.

In the Device Tree Evolution Project (DTE) the idea was born to provide a
UEFI protocol which can be called by a boot manager to request the firmware
to apply fix-ups to a device-tree.

A draft specification for such a protocol can be found at:
https://github.com/U-Boot-EFI/EFI_DT_FIXUP_PROTOCOL

The first patch implements the protocol. The second allows the dtbdump.efi
test tool to load a flattened device-tree and call the
EFI_DT_FIXUP_PROTOCOL to apply fix-ups, make memory reservations and
finally install the device tree as a configuration table. In a next step
this configuration table can be dumped to a file.
